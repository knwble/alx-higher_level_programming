- Advanced Task 30: Write a function magic_string() that returns a string “Holberton” n times the number of the iteration.
- Advanced Task 31: Write a class LockedClass with no class or object attribute, that prevents the user from dynamically creating new instance attributes, except if the new instance attribute is called first_name.
