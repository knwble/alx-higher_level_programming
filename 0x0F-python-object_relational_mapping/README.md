# 0x0F. Python - Object-relational mapping
- Task 0: Write a script that lists all states from the database hbtn_0e_0_usa.
- Task 1: Write a script that lists all states with a name starting with N (upper N) from the database hbtn_0e_0_usa.
- Task 2: Write a script that takes in an argument and displays all values in the states table of hbtn_0e_0_usa where name matches the argument.
- Task 3: Write a script that takes in arguments and displays all values in the states table of hbtn_0e_0_usa where name matches the argument. But this time, write one that is safe from MySQL injections!
- Task 4: Write a script that lists all cities from the database hbtn_0e_4_usa.
- Task 5: Write a script that takes in the name of a state as an argument and lists all cities of that state, using the database hbtn_0e_4_usa.
- Task 6: Write a python file that contains the class definition of a State and an instance Base = declarative_base().
- Task 7: Write a script that lists all State objects from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa.
- Task 8: Write a script that prints the first State object from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa.
- Task 9: Write a script that lists all State objects that contain the letter a from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa.
- Task 10: Write a script that prints the State object with the name passed as argument from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa.
- Task 11: Write a script that adds the State object “Louisiana” to the database hbtn_0e_6_usa.
- Task 12: Write a script that changes the name of a State object from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa.
- Task 13: Write a script that deletes all State objects with a name containing the letter a from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa.
